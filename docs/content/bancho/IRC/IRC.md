<p hidden> I am aware of the multiple grammar issues present in this article, as it was somewhat rushed and I'm too lazy right now to be bothered (slightly because I didn't sleep at all last night).</p>

## Interent Relay Chat

Internet Relay Chat, better known and mostly abbreviated as IRC, is a text-based chat protocol first introduced in 1988.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) The chat protocol used Bancho is IRC and can be connected to via an IRC client such as HexChat.[[2]](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Community/Internet_Relay_Chat) 

### Connecting to osu!Bancho:

To connect to osu!Bancho using IRC, obviously an IRC client is needed. When connecting, please disable SSL and SASL when connecting.
___

- Server: `cho.ppy.sh` or `irc.ppy.sh`.

- Port: `6667`.

- SSL: disabled.

- Login: default (username + IRC password).

- Username: Self-explanatory, however; it is worth noting that spaces cannot be used for this field. Instead use a dash. For example: instead of `Windows Me`, instead use `Windows_Me`. 

- Password: Your IRC password retrieved [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit#legacy-api). Note: even though you are NOT using your osu! account password, common sense should tell you that you shouldn't share any personal data which includes passwords such as this one.

### History

The person who programmed BanchoBot and maintained the IRC protocol used for Bancho was [Echo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/431), It is unknown whether they are still involved with the development of Bancho considering Echo's profile has the role of Alumini.[[4]](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/BanchoBot)[[5]](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Bancho_%28server%29)[[2]](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Community/Internet_Relay_Chat)[[7]](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/History_of_osu%21/2007#november)
