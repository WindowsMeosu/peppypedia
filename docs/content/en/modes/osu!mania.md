# osu!mania

osu!mania is a playmode that offers more of a playstyle unique to Beatmania, Dance Dance Revolution/StepMania, Guitar/Clone Hero and many other vertical scrolling rhythm games (VSRGs). Like many other VSRGs, osu!mania's scoring is capped at 1,000,000 which can be achieved by hitting all notes within a 16ms hit error (This value is unaffected by the beatmap's overall difficulty. The only modifications which changes this value are Easy {EZ} and Hard Rock {HR}).
