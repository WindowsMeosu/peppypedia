# I'm not accepting any real-life money for this project as I don't know which direction I want peppypedia to go. If you want, feel free to gift me a supporter tag. I'd appreciate knowing that people actually care about peppypedia.
# in the future, I'd probably allow people to support this project wih real-life currency for a low price of probably 2 dollars or less (I don't ask for much).
# peppypedia will neither be behind any paywalls nor will you be forced to pay. This site will be free as long as github exists (and even if anything happens, I'll probably just manually host it).
