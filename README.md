# peppypedia
this version of peppypedia is a reworked version of the now depreciated jekyll-HTML ver peppypedia. Please note that this is still running jekyll (or technically still running jekyll) since github-pages uses jekyll as an `pre-installed dependency`. With this site, many jekyll resources WON'T be used. (which was flooding up the directories)

Some code here may not belong to me.
