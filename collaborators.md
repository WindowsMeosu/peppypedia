# Collaborators

Interested in collaborating for peppypedia? If so, please DM me on [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/messages/users/28893698).
I am looking for those who are willing to actively work on this project, are very knowledgeable with Markdown and preferably Git. Although there is only one requirement (technically two if you meet the other), I do apologize if you are unable to meet it. I am looking for people who have experience with Markdown and markdown-based projects and thus cannot satisfy everyone. \
Requirement(s):

 - Must have contributed to or operate a markdown-based project that exists on GitHub (or optionally GitLab). For example, osu-wiki. Cannot have less than 4 contributions.

 - (optional) Has contributed to peppypedia.

 Collaborators will get access to a Matrix server (optional, whether you decide to join the server is your choice) in order to discuss and chat about anything peppypedia.
