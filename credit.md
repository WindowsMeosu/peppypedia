## Contribution Credits

## Authors

Author fields display the osu! profile of whoever authored the page. Rewritting a page entirely will result in a change of authorship.

Section authors, if any, shall be credited at the contributor field.

###### Example

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./content/en//users/contributor.css">
 
![Windows_Me](https://a.ppy.sh/28893698_q.jpeg#contributor) (Technical contributor)![Unknown](https://a.ppy.sh/02#contributor) (Section author, authored [example section](#none))

if `show_author` is set to `false`, no author field will be shown. The author may still be named in the page's yaml data.

## Contributors

Contributor fields, self-explanatory (displays contributors). These do not show if `show_contributors` is set to false.
